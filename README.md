# Walmart Data Analysis: SQL + Python 

## Project Overview

![Project Pipeline](image.jpg)


This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL)
   - **Goal**: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

### 2. Set Up Kaggle API
   - **API Setup**: Obtain Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   - **Configure Kaggle**: 
      - Placed the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in my local `.kaggle` folder.
      - Used the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into my project.

### 3. Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Used the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
   - **Storage**: Saved the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.

### 4. Installed Required Libraries and Loaded Data
   - **Libraries**: Installed necessary Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
     ```
   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 5. Explored the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Used functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 6. Data Cleaning
   - **Removed Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handled Missing Values**: Droped rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; filled values where essential.
   - **Fixed Data Types**: Ensured all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Used `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Checked for any remaining inconsistencies and verified the cleaned data.

### 7. Feature Engineering
   - **Created New Columns**: Calculate the `Total Amount` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field streamlined further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### 8. Load Data into MySQL
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connected to MySQL using `sqlalchemy` and loaded the cleaned data into each database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in MySQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### 9. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Wrote and executed complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
   - **Documentation**: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.
